CUDA Library Support: Currently on the Sandy/Ivy node, only magma-1.3.0/magma-1.5.0 with cuda/5.0 can be compiled. magma-1.3.0 with cuda/5.5, magma-1.4.1 with cuda/5.0, and magma-1.4.1 with cuda/5.5 all failed in the process of "make".

Before "make", perform "module load cuda/5.0" to make sure the correct CUDA library is loaded.

Compiler Support: Only GCC version 4.7 or lower can be used.

Before "make", perform "module load compilers/gcc-4.6.2" to make sure the correct compiler is loaded.
